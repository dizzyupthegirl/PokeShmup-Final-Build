However, once she gets past all the members of the church, she sadly must battle Victini, and either die at the hand of the one she loves, or kill her. [sad music plays]

How to play the game: Using a fight stick, shoot the Pokemon coming at you, keep a level head and a steady trigger finger. Don't die.

Requirements: Joystick, bro	Known bugs and issues: Sometimes Lucario decide to randomly teleport. We have no idea why, but it's probably because he's scared. Also, sometimes Victini gives you 2000 pts instead of 1000. On lower resolutions, the scoring is all screwed up.
